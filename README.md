# picovina
A software suite for my custom cyberdeck project based on the **Orange Pi 5 MAX** running **Armbian**.

This repository will gradually include system configurations, kernel modules, scripts, services, and optimization guides as they become available. It is also adaptable to other single-board computers, such as Raspberry Pi, Radxa, and more.

# pi-battery
A kernel module based on **rpi-integrated-battery**, paired with a battery monitoring service, designed for use with the Waveshare UPS 3S module featuring the INA219 chip.

**Project folder:** [pi-battery](./pi-battery)
