# About Pičovina

**Project name: "Pičovina"** (pronounced /ˈpɪ.tʃo.vi.na/)

> The name "Pičovina" is a playful blend of the "Pi" prefix, commonly associated with single-board computer projects like Raspberry Pi, Orange Pi, Banana Pi etc, and a colloquial term from my native language, which humorously refers to something that's perhaps not entirely useful. Despite the tongue-in-cheek name, this project serves a practical purpose.

A software suite for my custom cyberdeck project based on the **Orange Pi 5 MAX** running **Armbian**.

This repository will gradually include system configurations, kernel modules, scripts, services, and optimization guides as they become available. It is also adaptable to other single-board computers, such as Raspberry Pi, Radxa, and more.

*For a quick idea of the project setup – still in the very first functional version, but I have some new ideas for improvements*

# Armbian Postinstall
Post-installation steps after a fresh Armbian setup.

**Project folder:** [armbian-postinstall](./armbian-postinstall)

# pi-battery
A kernel module based on **rpi-integrated-battery**, paired with a battery monitoring service, designed for use with the Waveshare UPS 3S module featuring the INA219 chip.

**Project folder:** [pi-battery](./pi-battery)

# ag - apt-get Lazyfier
Because I'm quite lazy and commands like `apt-get install ...` can be long to type, I created a small script that simplifies working with apt, apt-get, or apt-cache commands.

**Project folder:** [apt-get Lazyfier](./ag)
